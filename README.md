# COMPASS - Dynamics of Youth Polysubstance Use (PSU) Patterns
In this project, we explore the dynamic transitions of polysubstance use (PSU) patterns from a large cohort of Canadian secondary school students using [COMPASS](https://uwaterloo.ca/compass-system/about) data, and address the gap that limited evidence exists to examine the factors that impact the dynamics of PSU patterns among youth.

## General Information
This repository documents the project aims, technologies used, features, and future work. 

## Technologies Used
- Missing data analysis and multiple imputation
- LASSO regression 
- Latent Markov Model (LMM)

## Features

## Future Work
- Explore age difference and other characteristic differences in the dynamic transition of use patterns among youth by conducting a stratified analysis using the LMM method
- Add mental health assessment and data elements that reflect school environments, school health policies and practices to examine the dynamics of PSU over a longer period
